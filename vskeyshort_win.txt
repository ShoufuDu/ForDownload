To All,
As most of you are aware, today is my last working day at Ainsworth Game Technology. Leaving this company was one of the toughest decisions I’ve had to make. But as I move on, I would like to take a moment to remember the journey I had with you. 
It’s been great interacting and knowing each one of you. I have shared a unique camaraderie with many of you which I hope will continue in the years to come. Personally, it’s been an amazing experience for me and I truly appreciate having had this wonderful opportunity to work with you all. I’ll be taking with me some very fond memories of my time here.
I am quite active on social media and look forward to keeping in touch with you guys on Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram. 
Thanks again everyone and I wish you all the very best for the future 
